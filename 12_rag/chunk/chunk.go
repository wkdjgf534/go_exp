package chunk

// chunk splits text into overlapping windows of approximately
// size bytes. When the window's right edge falls near a paragraph,
// sentence, or word boundary, the cut is moved to that boundary so
// chunks read more naturally and similarity search aligns with
// human-meaningful units.
//
// Why boundary-aware chunking matters: an embedding is a single vector
// summarizing the meaning of its input. If you slice in the middle of
// a sentence, both halves get a degraded embedding — neither carries
// the full thought. By preferring paragraph boundaries (then sentence,
// then word) we keep ideas intact, which gives the retriever cleaner
// signal to match against.
//
// More sophisticated splitters exist (token-aware, semantic
// recursive-character, transformer-based), but this one works well
// and is sufficient for our purposes.
//
// "Approximately" because boundary-seeking trims the tail of a window;
// resulting chunks are typically 70–100% of size. Empty input
// produces no chunks.

import "strings"

// Indexing is byte-based for simplicity; the boundary patterns
// ("\n\n", ". ", " ") are ASCII, so cuts cannot land mid-rune unless
// the text contains a long run of non-ASCII with no whitespace —
// vanishingly rare for the course's source material.
